# CI/CD Attacks

> CI/CD pipelines are often triggered by untrusted actions such a forked pull requests and new issue submissions for public git repositories. These systems often contain sensitive secrets or run in privileged environments. Attackers may gain an RCE into such systems by submitting crafted payloads that trigger the pipelines. Such vulnerabilities are also known as Poisoned Pipeline Execution (PPE).
